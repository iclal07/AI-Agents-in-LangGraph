# üöÄ AI Agents in LangGraph - Course Notebooks

Welcome to the **AI Agents in LangGraph** course notebooks! This repository contains the notebooks from the course offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph), where you'll explore the world of AI agents using the powerful LangGraph framework.

## ü§ñ What are AI Agents?

AI agents are the building blocks of intelligent systems. These software entities are designed to interact with their environment, learn from it, and make decisions to achieve specific goals. They can operate autonomously or with minimal human intervention, making them crucial in various applications, from chatbots to autonomous vehicles.

### üåü Key Features of AI Agents

- **Autonomy**: AI agents can operate independently, making decisions without human input.
- **Adaptability**: They learn and evolve based on new data, improving their performance over time.
- **Interaction**: AI agents communicate with other systems, agents, or humans to fulfill their objectives.
- **Goal-Oriented**: They are driven by specific goals, whether it's completing a task, optimizing a process, or achieving a certain outcome.

### üîç How AI Agents Work

AI agents function through a cycle of perception, decision-making, and action:

1. **Perception**: The agent gathers information from its environment using sensors or data inputs.
2. **Decision-Making**: It processes the perceived information and decides the best course of action based on predefined goals or learned behaviors.
3. **Action**: The agent executes its decision, interacting with its environment or other entities.
4. **Learning**: Through feedback loops, the agent updates its knowledge base, allowing it to improve future decisions.

### üß† Types of AI Agents

- **Reactive Agents**: These agents respond to stimuli from their environment without considering the history of previous states. They are simple and fast but lack long-term planning capabilities.
- **Deliberative Agents**: Equipped with a model of their environment, these agents can plan and make decisions that take future states into account. They are more complex and capable of handling intricate tasks.
- **Learning Agents**: These agents have the ability to improve their performance by learning from experiences. They use techniques like reinforcement learning to optimize their behavior over time.
- **Hybrid Agents**: Combining features from reactive and deliberative agents, hybrid agents can react to immediate changes while also planning for the future.

## üìö Course Lessons
